Explanation:
Parameters Initialization:

The class CombinedRotaryEmbedding initializes parameters for Givens rotations (self.thetas), the rotation matrix (self.rotation_matrix), and the inverse frequencies for rotary embeddings (self.inv_freq).

self.thetas: Parameters for the Givens rotations angles.

self.rotation_matrix: A learnable rotation matrix initialized as an identity matrix.

self.inv_freq: Precomputed inverse frequencies for rotary embeddings.

Givens Rotation Matrix:

The method givens_rotation_matrix computes the Givens rotation matrix for given indices i, j, and angle theta.

This matrix performs a rotation in the plane defined by the axes i and j.

Forward Pass (_forward method):

Input Reshaping:

The input tensor x is reshaped to combine the batch size, sequence length, number of heads, and head dimension for processing.

Givens Rotations:

Applies a series of Givens rotations to the input tensor.

Iterates over the number of rotations specified by self.num_rotations.

Rotation Matrix Application:

Applies the learnable rotation matrix to the tensor.

Rotary Embeddings:

Computes sinusoidal embeddings using the inverse frequencies.

Applies these embeddings to the rotated tensor to incorporate positional information.

Output Reshaping:

Reshapes the tensor back to its original dimensions.



Part of the rotation block:
$$
n_{\text{state}}, n_{\text{head}}, \text{num\_rotations}, \text{base}=10000, \text{checkpointing}=\text{False}
$$

The hidden dimension \( \text{h\_dim} \) is calculated as:
$$
\text{h\_dim} = \frac{n_{\text{state}}}{n_{\text{head}}}
$$

The parameters \texttt{thetas} and \texttt{rotation\_pairs} are initialized as:
$$
\texttt{thetas} = \mathbf{0}
$$
$$
\texttt{rotation\_pairs} = \text{rand}(\text{num\_rotations}, 2) \times \text{h\_dim}
$$

The rotation matrix is an identity matrix:
$$
\texttt{rotation\_matrix} = \mathbf{I}_{\text{h\_dim}}
$$

The inverse frequency is computed as:
$$
\texttt{inv\_freq} = \frac{1.0}{\text{base}^{\frac{\text{torch.arange}(0, \text{h\_dim}, 2)}{\text{h\_dim}}}}
$$

The Givens rotation matrix \( G \) is defined as:
$$
G = \mathbf{I}_{n_{\text{state}}}
$$
$$
G_{ii} = \cos(\theta), \quad G_{ij} = -\sin(\theta)
$$
$$
G_{ji} = \sin(\theta), \quad G_{jj} = \cos(\theta)
$$

The rotary orthogonal matrix \( R \) used in the forward pass is computed as:
$$
R = \text{rotation\_matrix} \cdot G
$$

$$ \mathbf{x}{\text{transformed}} = \mathbf{x} \cdot \left( \prod{k=1}^{N} G_k \right) \cdot R $$




Benefits of Combining:
Efficiency: Reduces the overhead of managing multiple classes and potentially improves computational efficiency by consolidating operations.

Consistency: Ensures all rotations and embeddings are applied in a unified way, which can be beneficial for model consistency.

Simplification: Simplifies the integration into models that require all three levels of rotation.
