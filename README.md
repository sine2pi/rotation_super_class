Explanation:
Parameters Initialization:

The class CombinedRotaryEmbedding initializes parameters for Givens rotations (self.thetas), the rotation matrix (self.rotation_matrix), and the inverse frequencies for rotary embeddings (self.inv_freq).

self.thetas: Parameters for the Givens rotations angles.

self.rotation_matrix: A learnable rotation matrix initialized as an identity matrix.

self.inv_freq: Precomputed inverse frequencies for rotary embeddings.

Givens Rotation Matrix:

The method givens_rotation_matrix computes the Givens rotation matrix for given indices i, j, and angle theta.

This matrix performs a rotation in the plane defined by the axes i and j.

Forward Pass (_forward method):

Input Reshaping:

The input tensor x is reshaped to combine the batch size, sequence length, number of heads, and head dimension for processing.

Givens Rotations:

Applies a series of Givens rotations to the input tensor.

Iterates over the number of rotations specified by self.num_rotations.

Rotation Matrix Application:

Applies the learnable rotation matrix to the tensor.

Rotary Embeddings:

Computes sinusoidal embeddings using the inverse frequencies.

Applies these embeddings to the rotated tensor to incorporate positional information.

Output Reshaping:

Reshapes the tensor back to its original dimensions.




Benefits of Combining:
Efficiency: Reduces the overhead of managing multiple classes and potentially improves computational efficiency by consolidating operations.

Consistency: Ensures all rotations and embeddings are applied in a unified way, which can be beneficial for model consistency.

Simplification: Simplifies the integration into models that require all three levels of rotation.
